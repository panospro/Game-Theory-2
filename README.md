# The first problem:
Two companies produce the same product. Company n produces xn ∈ [0,∞) units. The price of the product when for total production x = $x^1 +x^2$ units is P(x) = 100−2√x.
The cost per unit is $C^1(x^1)$ = $x^1$ + 10 for Company 1 and $C^2(x^2)$= $2x^2$ + 5
for firm 2. Find the profit functions, level producer NE, and the corresponding gains.

# The second problem:
There are N citizens in a country, and the n-th citizen receives $v_n$ units when
participates in a demonstration. Even though the cost of participating in the demonstration is
for each state c/k, where c > 0 and k is the number of demonstrators. Then the
return of n- to the citizen is $v_n$ −c/k when it manifests and 0 when it does not manifest.
Let c > $v_1$ > $v_2$ > ... > $v_N$ = 0. Find all NEs.

# The third problem:
N ≥ 2 firms produce the same product. Suppose that n- in the company produces $x^n$ ∈ [0,∞)
units, with the cost of producing one unitcn. The price of the product is $P(x^1 + ... + x^N)$
=100 − $x^1 + ... + x^N$ when $x^1 + ... + x^N$ ≤ 100 and $P(x^1 + ... + x^N)$ = 0 when $x^1 + ... + x^N$ > 100
let's assume that
0 < $c^1 < c^2 = c^3 = ... = c^N$
and there exists NE $\hat{x}$ = $\hat{x^1}$, $\hat{x^2}$, ..., $\hat{x^N}$ thus, for each n,
$\hat{x^1}$ $\neq$ $\hat{x^2}$ = ... = $\hat{x^N}$ .
Calculate the $\hat{x^n}$
